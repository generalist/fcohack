# fcohack
Notes from the #fcohack event September 2018

* wikidata-names.tsv - crossreferences between name strings from Section A (which seem to be used as primary keys) and Wikidata item QIDs
* all-data.tsv - crossreferences between name strings from Section A, Wikidata item QIDs, and all postings
* alignscript - a big messy pile of bash to make sense of it
